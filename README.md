# waves
Global Game Jam 2017 Game with the theme 'waves'.

Waves is an experimental inverse idle/incremental game, where your number gets smaller over time. Unlike the vacuous positive reward of increasing numbers exponentially, you experience the slow agonising slog of inching towards 0. Just like being lost at sea. Is it even possible to reach dry land? Probably not.

It turns out that there's a good reason that inverse idle games don't really exist.

When you play, remember that it takes a good few clicks before you start to see an effect.
